            <p>In this class we focused on using methods of interaction design with the context of understanding health
              challenges. We focused on designing products and services while focusing on user experience. With an emphasis on health and wellbeing,
              we’re able to focus on what is best for the user to maximize their experience with technology and new products. </p>

          <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>We wanted to answer this question: How might we create an enriching and meaningful experience at the intersection of nutrition and community for elderly adults? </p>
        <p>In this project, we paired up with Crown Center to create a new service to fulfill the resident’s needs health-wise. To create the best possible user experience we immersed ourselves in their environment to better understand their needs and desires.  Our group wanted to focus more on transportation and building communities to maximize residents' well-being.</p>

  <h1>Health and Well Being for Older Adults</h1>
  <p>The environment older adults live in seems to have a difference in the way they self
    report their health. Those who lived in supportive environments reported better health rates.
    Also, those who have low mental and physical health seemed to be greatly impacted by the environment
    that they live in. Adequate housing, neighborhood, and social support can increase self-rated health,
    resilience, and social inclusion. Older adults should also do some type of physical activity every day
    and need to eat a variety of foods as they need more different types of nutrients such as potassium and
    calcium as they age. </p>

      <br>
    <h1>Volunteers</h1>
    <p>Studies have shown that individuals with inadequate personal resources such as low income were less likely to volunteer. To include a wider population of volunteers there needs to be increased flexibility in time commitments and they should be able to choose the type of volunteer activities they participate in. People were also more willing to volunteer when the community provided them with some form of compensation and recognized the importance of their volunteer work.</p>

    <h1>Crown Center</h1>
    <p>Crown Center hosts many diverse cultural events as well as events related to cooking, musical, studying, clubs, and exercise. They make it clear on what kind of events happen in the month with a flier and post all the meals that will be given there as well. They also have bus rides that take residents to the supermarket and events that are out of Crown Center were also listed for people to view at the beginning of the month. We also took a tour of their living facilities and saw how they were geared towards older adults as there were lower kitchens
      and sinks. There were also bathrooms with handicapped features such as railings
       and there were emergency buttons that people can pull in case of emergency around the apartment.</p>

      <p> This program works to help homebound seniors get the nutritional meals they need.
        The people who request these meals are more vulnerable to mental health issues, have
        anxiety about daily living such as falling and have health hazards. After their continued
        use of Meals On wheels, users showed signs of improvements in health, mental conditions, and
        felt a better satisfaction in life as they felt less lonely and worried about being home alone.
         And has the potentiality to help people decrease their hospital bills. There were also greater
         benefits in receiving meals by hand rather than receiving frozen meals. </p>

        and to help older adults challenge themselves in new ways even as they age. </p>

              <h3>Idea 1 </h3>
              <p> We wanted to create a way for communicating with international
                residents since they seemed to have a language barrier. We were
                initially thinking of creating a translation service that can socially
                 engage residents such as creating an event contains different activities
                 that doesn’t require to talk.  </p>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
              <h3>Idea 2 </h3>
              <p>A way to pair a group of younger adults to older adults like a pen pal to teach them
                about what is going on in the current world such as pop culture and how to use technology.
                These pen pal meetings would try to create some change in their everyday lifestyle.
                However, this ideas seemed very similar to Create Circles and we wanted to create a new fresh idea.</p>

            <h1>1)Issues with Transportation / Getting Food</h1>
            <p>Here is a quote from a Crown Center Resident after being asked if they cook for themselves and they began to explain how they get their  food supply:</p>
               <blockquote>“I don’t go to the grocery store because the bus can only take 2 people with chairs at a time. I let other people take it because they may not have as many food options as I do.” </blockquote>

               <p>Residents also mentioned that they used services called Instacart food which brings food to their door and is really helpful for when they are sick and can’t go out, but the internet is necessary and they usually have to tip people. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, our interview with a student resident volunteer informed us that some residents used a service called Call-a-Ride for going to places such as hospital appointments, but they had to wait long periods of time and it was not very convenient for residents. Thus, we wanted to address these solutions by creating a system where residents can transport themselves with more efficiency and care. Residents will be able to post their own available times and create their own events to get them where they need to be at the right time. </p>

                  <h1>2)Creating a Social Environment in Crown Center</h1>
                  <h3> Here are some of the issues that Residents have pointed out:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>We were informed through interviews that when going to eat meals down in the café, people regularly sit in the same tables with the same people and don’t really try to meet new people.</li>
                    <li>Residents also stated that there day to day life is pretty similar and nothing is really new.</li>
                    <li>There was also a language barrier between residents as some of the residents were not comfortable with speaking English.</li>

      <h1> Solution </h1>
      <p> We wanted to create a way for residents to meet new people and do activities together.
        Thus, we are giving them the freedom to create any event that is open to all the residents on
        Crown Center. They can go to the grocery store together, or shop at the mall together, go to the zoo,
        or even go to the hair salon together. We wanted to create a system where a person can find a buddy by
        just doing things they would do in their everyday life. </p>

        <h3>How do we assure the volunteers come to the events and do not back out last minute? </h3>
        <p> We were thinking of creating a point system for each volunteer and when they would not show up to an event without a 24-hour notice there rating would go down. After a couple of warnings, they will lose
          their ability to be a volunteer for a set amount of time. </p>
            <img  id=save src="save.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        <h3>What if people want to go to an event alone or wants to recruit a
          volunteer for an event but not have all the residents see the event (Ex) Going to a Funeral,
          a surprise birthday party, etc)?</h3>
        <p>We are thinking of enabling people to request private events.
          So that people do not exploit having an event only for themselves,
          Crown Center will check the form and if approved they will pair them
          up with a volunteer to do their task.  Residents may also be able to
          request certain volunteers so that they can meet a volunteer again when they had a nice experience with them the last time.</p>

          <img  src="private.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        <h3> Does a volunteer have to stay for the full duration of the event
          (Ex) pick up and drop off?)</h3>
        <p> We recommend for the volunteers to stay with the residents if the event is not
          as personal such as shopping for groceries so that they are able to help them during
          the event and bond with them since PIckMe is to encourage community engagement. However,
          for longer appointments and personal events, volunteers may come back after the appointment
          is done to drop them off at Crown Center. </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>When a resident needs special care how do we make sure they will be
            helped properly by volunteers?</h3>
          <p>For the case for people with wheelchairs, volunteers who have big enough cars will
            only be qualified to volunteer for that event. Other special needs will also be considered
            and only volunteers who are eligible to accompany the resident will be able to volunteer for
            that event. Events with someone with special needs will be marked and made clear
            that they require more alertness from the volunteer. </p>

      <div class=container>
        <p>We needed to consider options to when people would not own a digital device
          and how to contact them about sudden changes in the events or just to remind them of details.
          From knowledge of our own grandparents/interviews/background information, we were able to realize that
          seniors have a wide range of technology that they own. Some own phones, some have smartphones,
          some are comfortable using a laptop, and some do not own any.</p>

          <p>To account for a variety of technology
          resources, we decided to send text messages/ calls/ and emails. Rather than our initial idea of having
          a Crown Center worker call everyone on the event list, we thought that this would be more efficient and
          take less time. </p>

          <p>From secondary research, we also learned that more and more seniors have become comfortable
          with the use of technology and thought these technology-based reminders will be efficient to alert them about
          any details about their events. Technology availability also seemed to vary depending on their income and
          financial status so for residents who did not have internet access so we opted for a more traditional
          sign-up sheet (analog). </p>

          <!-- <h3> Our Process</h3> -->
          <ul>
            <li>Visited Crown Center to gather basic info</li>
              <br>
            <li>Researched senior livings and interviewed residents</li>
            <br>
            <li>Based on research and interviews, we discovered the problem with transportation.</li>
              <br>
            <li>We brought in different parties to fulfill different needs. </li>
              <br>
            <li>Approached in a digital and analog way, so that it can be used by many people.</li>
              <br>
            <li>Based on feedback, we re-shaped our service.</li>
              <br>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <p>  When visiting Crown Center to do the interviews, we learned a lot about how to develop interview questions, how to conduct an interview, organizing the information we received, and simplifying the content. These were all very new things for us, but it was a very enjoyable process to learn about different viewpoints.</p>
<br>
<p>It was also a bit hard to get in contact with one of the people we interviewed, she did not receive text messages and could only take calls. Also when trying to match schedules it was difficult to find a good time to meet since it was hard to match up with her busy schedule.</p>
<br>
<p>After talking with the people from Crown Center and having a look at what other teams had found, we dissected down the main problems that we wanted to solve for residents which was transportation and building a community amongst residents. We were unable to account for all the issues and only focused on these two problems since it was a reoccurring thing that seemed to be mentioned when doing the interviews. </p>
<br>
<p>Also, we began to conduct solutions to approach a wide variety of technology owners since older adults seemed to have a wide range in the devices that they own. So we developed both a digital and analogue way of using PickMe. We also had a bit of trouble coming up with how we were to contact the residents on the event list since there was such a variety of devices they might have been using. It would have been nice to know the age population and what kinds of device people from Crown Center  to develop this part of our project.<p>
<br>
<p>After creating the wireframes, storyboards, and personas
  for PickMe we had gotten feedback on details that we did not notice such as
  how residents would communicate with volunteers when there is an emergency
  and how people will accommodate for handicaps/wheelchairs when in a vehicle. There were
  also suggestions for us to create a rating system and limiting their privileges as volunteers
  so that they feel more responsible to show up for the events they signed up for. Crown Center and students f
  rom other teams also suggested that we should also consider one-person events so we developed the private event feature
  for people to use. </p>
<br>
<p>We also had a bit of trouble figuring out what the progress is like
  to process events and check the volunteers since we were not sure of what Crown Center’s
  community guidelines were and how events should be processed. Since we were not really familiar
   with AI and how algorithms work to simplify data into categories for filtration, we were going
   to just have a Crown Center resident go through each event, but after some discussion, we realized
   that this would be a lot of work and time-consuming.</p>

            <h3> Lesson 1 </h3>
              <p>During the beginning stages of this assignment, we were able to learn about how to
                gather information through interviews, background information, and personal experience
                to understand out target audience. A lot of research was needed before trying to tackle
                our main issue of how to create a meaningful community for elderly adults since this was a
                 population we were not familiar with. </p>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3> Lesson 2 </h3>
            <p> In the beginning, we wanted to include all of the residents. However, we realized it’s  impossible to meet everyone’s needs, so we narrowed it down and focused more on a thing that we wanted to help. We learned which part to focus on and which part to give up.
 </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h3> Lesson 3 </h3>
            <p>Transferring an idea of PickMe into a
              visual representation was challenging. We had to think
              eeper and more thoroughly to include every feature we wanted. In this process, we missed many things. After receiving feedback, we had to think of an efficient way to transfer our thoughts. Our key to overcoming this hardship was communication. We talked to each other a lot through text messages and zoom meetings. We discussed how to improve the model and easy access to communication was very helpful.
