            <p>In this class we focus on using methods of interaction design with the context of understanding health
              challenges. We focus on designing products and services while focusing on user experience. With an emphasis on health and wellbeing,
              we’re able to focus on what is best for the user to maximize their experience with technology and new products. </p>

          <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>We wanted to answer this question : How might we create an enriching and meaningful experience at the
          intersection of nutrition and community for elderly adults?</p>
        <p>In this project we paired up with Crown Center to create a new service to fulfill
          the resident’s needs health-wise. To create the best possible user experience we immersed
          ourselves in their environment to better understand their needs and desires.  Our group
          wanted to focus more on transportation and building community to maximize residents' well-being.</p>

  <h1>Health and Well Being for Older Adults</h1>
  <p>The environment older adults live in seems to have a difference in the way they self
    report their health. Those who lived in supportive environments reported better health rates.
    Also those who have low mental and physical health seemed to be greatly impacted by the environment
    that they live in. Adequate housing, neighborhood, and social support can increase self-rated health,
    resilience, and social inclusion. Older adults should also do some type of physical activity every day
    and need to eat a variety of foods as they need more different types of nutrients such as potassium and
    calcium as they age. </p>

    <h1>Volunteers</h1>
    <p>Studies have shown that  individuals with inadequate personal
      resources such as low income were less likely to volunteer. To include a
      wider population of volunteers there need to be an increased flexibility in time commitments,
      being able to choose the type of volunteer activities they participate in, and providing
      them with some form of compensation, and to recognize the importance of their volunteer work.</p>

    <h1>Crown Center</h1>

    <p>Crown Center hosts many diverse cultural events as well as events related to cooking,
      musical, studying, clubs, and exercise. They make it clear on what kind of events happen in the month with a flier and post all the meals that will be given there as well. They also have bus rides that take residents to the supermarket
      and events that are out of Crown Center were also listed for people to view in the beginning of the month.</p>

      <div class="container">
      <h1> Meals on Wheels </h1>
      <p> This program works to help homebound seniors get the nutritional meals they need.
        The people who request these meals are more vulnerable to mental health issues, have
        anxiety about daily living such as falling, and have health hazards. After their continued
        use of Meals On wheels, users showed signs of improvements in health, mental conditions, and
        felt a better satisfaction in life as they felt less lonely and worried about being home alone.
         And has the potentiality to help people decrease their hospital bills. There were also greater
         benefits in receiving meals by hand rather than receiving frozen meals. </p>
      <h1>Create Circles</h1>
      <p> Created by Moolani, Create Circles, is a non profit organization
        that pairs up young volunteers to older adults in long-term care facilities
        to make creative projects. Their goal was to change the negative views on aging
        and to help older adults challenge themselves in new ways even as they age. </p>

              <h3>Idea 1 </h3>
              <p> We wanted to create a way for communication with international residents since there
                seemed to be a language barrier. We were thinking of maybe creating a translation service that will help
                people do more social things rather than things such as filling out documents such as
                language classes or games. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6" ">
              <h3>Idea 2 </h3>
              <p>A way to pair a group of younger adults to older adults like a pen pal to teach them
                about what is going on in the current world such as pop culture and how to use technology.
                These pen pal meetings would try to create some change in their everyday lifestyle.
                However, this ideas seemed very similar to Create Circles and we wanted to create a new fresh idea.</p>

            <h1>1)Issues with Transportation / Getting Food</h1>
            <p>Here is a quote from a Crown Center Resident after being asked if they cook for themselves and they began to explain how they get their  food supply:</p>
               <blockquote>“I don’t go to the grocery store because the bus can only take 2 people with chairs at a time. I let other people take it because they may not have as many food options as I do.” </blockquote>

               <p>Residents also mentioned that they used services called Instacart food which brings food to their door and is really helpful for when they are sick and can’t go out, but the internet is necessary and they usually have to tip people. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, our interview with a student resident volunteer informed us that some residents used a service called Call-a-Ride for going to places such as hospital appointments, but they had to wait long periods of time and it was not very convenient to residents. Thus, we wanted to address these solutions by creating a system where residents can transport themselves with more efficiency and care. Residents will be able to post their own available times and create their own events to get them where they need to be at the right time. </p>

                  <h1>2)Creating a Social Environment in Crown Center</h1>
                  <h3> Here are some of the issues that Residents have pointed out:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>We were informed through interviews that when going to eat meals down in the café, people regularly sit in the same tables with the same people and don’t really try to meet new people.</li>
                    <li>Residents also stated that there day to day life is pretty similar and nothing is really new.</li>
                    <li>There was also a language barrier between residents as some of the residents were not comfortable with speaking English.</li>
                  </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class=container>
      <h1> Solution </h1>
      <p> We wanted to create a way for residents to meet new people and do activities together.
        Thus, we are giving them the freedom to create any event that is open to all the residents on
        Crown Center. They can go to the grocery store together, or shop at the mall together, go to the zoo,
        or even go to the hair salon together. We wanted to create a system where a person can find a buddy by
        just doing things they would do in their everyday life. </p>

Events will occur if one or more person and a volunteer join your event.
For an event created by a volunteer at least 2 residents must sign up for the event to occur.</p>
<p>If an event request is private, it means that the event is very specific to an individual resident, such as a doctor’s appointment or funeral. These events residents won’t need more people to sign up and will just need a volunteer.</p>

        <h3>How do we assure the volunteers come to the events and do not back out last minute? </h3>
        <p> We were thinking of creating a point system for each volunteer and when they would not show up to an event without a 24 hour notice there rating would go down. After a couple of warnings, they will lose
          their ability to be a volunteer for a set amount of time. </p>

        <h3>What if people want to go to an event alone or wants to recruit a
          volunteer for an event but not have all the residents see the event (Ex) Going to a Funeral,
          a surprise birthday party, etc)?</h3>
        <p>We are thinking of enabling people to request private events. So that people do
          not exploit having an event only for themselves, Crown Center will check the form and
          if approved they will pair them up with a volunteer to do their task.  Residents may
          also be able to request certain volunteers to be their host so that they can meet a
          volunteer again when they had a nice experience with them the last time. </p>

          <br>
        <h3> Does a volunteer have to stay for the full duration of the event
          (Ex) pick up and drop off?)</h3>
        <p> We recommend for the volunteers to stay with the residents if the event is not
          as personal such as shopping for groceries so that they are able to help them during
          the event and bond with them since PIckMe is to encourage community engagement. However,
          for longer appointments and personal events, volunteers may come back after the appointment
          is done to drop them off at Crown Center. </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>When a resident needs special care how do we make sure they will be
            helped properly by volunteers?</h3>
          <p>In the case for people with wheelchairs, volunteers who have big enough cars
            will only be qualified to volunteer for that event. Other special needs will also
            be considered and only volunteers who are eligible to accompany the resident will be
             able to volunteer for that event. Events with someone with special
            needs will be marked and made clear that they require more alertness from the volunteer.</p>

        <p>We needed to consider options to when people would not own a digital device
          and how to contact them about sudden changes in the events or just to remind them of details.
          From knowledge of our own grandparents/interviews/background information, we were able to realize that
          seniors have a wide range of technology that they own. Some own phones, some have smartphones,
          some are comfortable using a laptop, and some do not own any.</p>

          <p>To account for a variety of technology
          resources, we decided to send text messages/ calls/ and emails. Rather than our initial idea of having
          a Crown Center worker call everyone on the event list, we thought that this would be more efficient and
          take less time. </p>

          <p>From secondary research we also learned that more and more seniors have become comfortable
          with the use of technology and thought these technology based reminders will be efficient to alert them about
          any details about their events. Technology availability also seemed to vary depending on their income and
          financial status so for residents who did not have internet access so we opted for a more traditional
          sign up sheet (analog). </p>

            <h3> Lesson 1 </h3>
              <p>During the beginning stages of this assignment, we were able to learn about how to
                gather information through interviews, background information, and personal experience
                to understand out target audience. A lot of research was needed before trying to tackle
                our main issue of how to create a meaningful community for elderly adults since this was a
                 population we were not familiar with. </p>

            <h3> Lesson 2 </h3>
            <p> In the beginning, we wanted to include all of the residents so we tried
              to produce something that can include everyone. However, we found it impossible
              because each person has different needs and we needed to narrow it down and focus
               on a certain group of people. </p>
