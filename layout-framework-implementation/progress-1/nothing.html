  <h1>Context of the Class</h1>
  <p>In this class we focus on using methods of interaction design with the context of understanding health
    challenges. We focus on designing products and services while focusing on user experience. With an emphasis on health and wellbeing,
    we’re able to focus on what is best for the user to maximize their experience with technology and new products. </p>
    <h1>Project Overview</h1>
  <p>We wanted to answer this question : How might we create an enriching and meaningful experience at the
    intersection of nutrition and community for elderly adults?</p>
  <p>In this project we paired up with Crown Center to create a new service to fulfill
    the resident’s needs health-wise. To create the best possible user experience we immersed
    ourselves in their environment to better understand their needs and desires.  Our group
    wanted to focus more on transportation and building community to maximize residents' well-being.</p>
</div>
<div id="secondary_Research" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Health and Well Being for Older Adults</h1>
  <p>The environment older adults live in seems to have a difference in the way they self
    report their health. Those who lived in supportive environments reported better health rates.
    Also those who have low mental and physical health seemed to be greatly impacted by the environment
    that they live in. Adequate housing, neighborhood, and social support can increase self-rated health,
    resilience, and social inclusion. Older adults should also do some type of physical activity every day
    and need to eat a variety of foods as they need more different types of nutrients such as potassium and
    calcium as they age. </p>

    <h1>Volunteers</h1>
    <p>Studies have shown that  individuals with inadequate personal
      resources such as low income were less likely to volunteer. To include a
      wider population of volunteers there need to be an increased flexibility in time commitments,
      being able to choose the type of volunteer activities they participate in, and providing
      them with some form of compensation, and to recognize the importance of their volunteer work.</p>

    <h1>Crown Cente</h1>
    <h2> Things we learned from their website and from their tour </h2>
    <p>Crown Center hosts many diverse cultural events as well as events related to cooking,
      musical, studying, clubs, and exercise. They make it clear on what kind of events happen in the month with a flier and post all the meals that will be given there as well. They also have bus rides that take residents to the supermarket
      and events that are out of Crown Center were also listed for people to view in the beginning of the month.</p>
      <div id="similar_Programs" class="container-fluid">
      <h1> Meals on Wheels </h1>
      <p> This program works to help homebound seniors get the nutritional meals they need.
        The people who request these meals are more vulnerable to mental health issues, have
        anxiety about daily living such as falling, and have health hazards. After their continued
        use of Meals On wheels, users showed signs of improvements in health, mental conditions, and
        felt a better satisfaction in life as they felt less lonely and worried about being home alone.
         And has the potentiality to help people decrease their hospital bills. There were also greater
         benefits in receiving meals by hand rather than receiving frozen meals. </p>
      <h1>Create Circles</h1>
      <p> Created by Moolani, Create Circles, is a non profit organization
        that pairs up young volunteers to older adults in long-term care facilities
        to make creative projects. Their goal was to change the negative views on aging
        and to help older adults challenge themselves in new ways even as they age. </p>

      </div>
      <div id="initial_Ideas" class="container-fluid">
        <h1> Communication Amongst Residents </h1>
        <h2>Idea 1 </h2>
        <p> We wanted to create a way for communication with international residents since there
          seemed to be a language barrier. We were thinking of maybe creating a translation service that will help
          people do more social things rather than things such as filling out documents such as
          language classes or games. </p>
        <h2>Idea 2 </h2>
        <p>A way to pair a group of younger adults to older adults like a pen pal to teach them
          about what is going on in the current world such as pop culture and how to use technology.
          These pen pal meetings would try to create some change in their everyday lifestyle.
          However, this ideas seemed very similar to Create Circles and we wanted to create a new fresh idea.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="our_Focus" class="container-fluid">
      <h1> The Problem We Chose to Focus On<h1>
      <h2>Issues with Transportation / Getting Food</h2>
      <p>Here is a quote from a Crown Center Resident after being asked if they cook for themselves and they began to explain how they get their  food supply: “I don’t go to the grocery store because the bus can only take 2 people with chairs at a time. I let other people take it because they may not have as many food options as I do.” Residents also mentioned that they used services called Instacart food which brings food to their door and is really helpful for when they are sick and can’t go out, but the internet is necessary and they usually have to tip people. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, our interview with a student resident volunteer informed us that some residents used a service called Call-a-Ride for going to places such as hospital appointments, but they had to wait long periods of time and it was not very convenient to residents. Thus, we wanted to address these solutions by creating a system where residents can transport themselves with more efficiency and care. Residents will be able to post their own available times and create their own events to get them where they need to be at the right time. </p>
      <h2>Creating a Social Environment in Crown Center</h2>
      <h5> Here are some of the issues that Residents have pointed out:
      <ul>
        <li>We were informed through interviews that when going to eat meals down in the café, people regularly sit in the same tables with the same people and don’t really try to meet new people.</li>
        <li>Residents also stated that there day to day life is pretty similar and nothing is really new.</li>
        <li>There was also a language barrier between residents as some of the residents were not comfortable with speaking English.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2> Solution> </h2>
      <p> We wanted to create a way for residents to meet new people and do activities together.
        Thus, we are giving them the freedom to create any event that is open to all the residents on
        Crown Center. They can go to the grocery store together, or shop at the mall together, go to the zoo,
        or even go to the hair salon together. We wanted to create a system where a person can find a buddy by
        just doing things they would do in their everyday life. </p>
