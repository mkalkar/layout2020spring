      <p>McConnell made some last-minute changes: He unveiled a revised
        organizing resolution to set the rules for the impeachment trial after
        an uproar from Democrats and concerns from some Republicans. Now, each
        side will get 24 hours for opening arguments spread over three days,
        instead of two, and House evidence will be admitted unless there is
        a vote in opposition to it.</p>
      <p>Amendments were introduced: Senate Minority Leader Chuck
        Schumer has introduced three amendments — all requesting relevant
        documents from the White House, State Department and Office of Budget
        and Management. The Senate voted along party lines to table, or kill,
        the amendments. When the trial comes back
        from break, they'll hear debate on Schumer's fourth amendment.</p>
      <p>GOP senator hints at support for witnesses: Sen. Susan Collins,
        a Republican from Maine, issued a statement today saying it is
        “likely” that she will support a motion
        to subpoena witnesses later in the trial after both sides
        present their cases.</p>
